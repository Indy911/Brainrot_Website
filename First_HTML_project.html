<blockquote cite="https://corp.oup.com/news/brain-rot-named-oxford-word-of-the-year-2024">
<q>‘Brain rot’ is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, 
especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging.</q>
</blockquote>
<p>It is used as a modern day tactic to make people dumber</p>

<br>


<p>There is a common acronym for this known as <abbr title="Directive of Brainrot Incorporation">DBI</abbr>.</p>
<p>DBI stands for "Directive of Brainrot Incorporation." This term is used for the source from which brainrot originated.
   The infamous Skibidi Toilet meme. This meme was generated from a series in youtube called "skibidi toilet", a series based
   on toilets with heads popping out saying "skibidi". This was back in 2022 and the brainrot from then has gotten substantially
   worse.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom" title="Click on the very first video"target="_blank">Link towards the doom of the       neurons!</a> This pandemic has caused a 
   multitude of impacts on modern children(specifically gen alpha!).</p>

    <h3 style="font-size:5vw">Progressive Brainrot</h3>
    <p>The brainrot keeps evolving as the years pass.
       From the young-adults of gen z to growing kids of gen alpha
       our attention continually lowers to an abysmal depth.
       It is predicted that by 2035, a vast majority of people
       won't be able to read. This reading crisis if not is already
       prevalent in our youth today. Sources of this can be found on tiktok.
       Media culture proposes that not being able to read is perfectly fine.
       Infact, they rather think its backwards to read books instead of being glued
       to your phone. Sources suggest that due to the pandemic in 2020,
       students in second and third grade are now 30% behind from a typical year.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size:5vw">How our future looks like</h3>
    <p>Our future will all be woven into a thread of online personas.
       It is not a possibility anymore that the whole world will become online.
       Friendships, relationships and companions will be formed online through digital faces.
       With the rapid development of ai and the internet, it is to no one's surprise that
       we are all becoming anti-social creatures having less face-to-face interations, not being
       present in the outside world and heavily relying on technology to assist us through daily life.
       How does this all relate to brainrot you may ask?
       Brainrot is a term for the inability to utilise your brain. If we have various technologies to help us,
       where will we use of brain?
       It is not a mystery as to why our attention span has sunken low to alarming levels.
       Our future looks very bleak past ai development. Our world will run out of mysteries to solve
       And people won't use a single chromosome of their brain anymore.
       Thinking is coined as useless
       What is a mind?</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 5vw">Is 2025 the year of &qout; healing? &quot;</h3>
    <p>If observant enough, we see that 2025 hasn't been too jam-packed with memes or brainrot. In fact, there is a so-called "crisis" going on rigth now
       called the "the great meme depression" where users on social media are complaining that there hasn't been enough memes lately. This wasn't the case
       at the start of the year where some of the worst memes like "eye of rah" and "property in egypt" was introduced. It was during March that this meme
       depression first started with no new memes produced and the old ones all the way from 2021 being recycled. This has a very mixed opinion. While some
       think this is nostalgic and pleasant, others are suffering demanding for more memes.</p>
    <h3 style="font-size: 5vw">Update log</h3>
    <p>Not anymore. The great meme depression has ended. An influencer called "Ashton Hall" went viral for its absurd morning routine which has provided a
       a plethora of new memes for the users. This went so viral that even content creators like Logan Paul and Mr Beast made a mockery out of it.</p>
