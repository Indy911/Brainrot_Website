<blockquote cite="https://corp.oup.com/news/brain-rot-named-oxford-word-of-the-year-2024">
<q>‘Brain rot’ is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, 
especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging.</q>
</blockquote>
<p>It is used as a modern day tactic to make people dumber</p>

<p>There is a common acronym for this known as <abbr title="Directive of Brainrot Incorporation">DBI</abbr>.</p>
<p>DBI stands for "Directive of Brainrot Incorporation." This term is used for the source from which brainrot originated.
   The infamous Skibidi Toilet meme. This meme was generated from a series in youtube called "skibidi toilet", a series based
   on toilets with heads popping out saying "skibidi". This was back in 2022 and the brainrot from then has gotten substantially
   worse.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom" title="Click on the very first video"target="_blank">Link towards the doom of the       neurons!</a> This pandemic has caused a 
   multitude of impacts on modern children(specifically gen alpha!).</p>
